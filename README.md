# hello-world
Just testing how to make repositories in github.

Hello people, I will keep my anonimity in this branch, so call me Alex. 
I find that the first time in coding can be extemely nerve-wraking, but I have full faith that after building up the foundations of coding, I am certain that it will become gradually a much more enjoyable experience <3. I love lofi hip hop music.
